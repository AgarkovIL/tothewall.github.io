			<h3>1.The list</h3>
			Ostkreuz station. 
About 40 years old man wearing thick framed glasses explained to me in detail how I could get to the wall. I gave him a stack of sheets with our workshop program, which Alex Heide had given us on the 22 of February 2017. He wrote the route on the otherside of it.

		<h3>2.The map</h3>
		25 of February 2017.Westkreuz station. I have been standing in the centre of the platform for a pretty long period of time peering into a map.  A man, appeared to be in his 50’, walked toward my direction. He gave me his map. I told him, that I wanted  to get to the wall. He wrote train numbers on the map and marked stations to switch he also marked some location which he thought are worth visiting as a tourist.

		<h3>The note on the photo.</h3>
		27 of February 2017.
Ostkreuz station. 
A girl in her 20’ wearing black glasses, big scarf and headphones. She mentioned several stations where I could see the wall and I didn't remember any of them and asked her to write them down. She didn't have anything to write on, so I gave her the picture I had made on 26-th of February 2017. It was Ostkreuz written on one side, she wrote Warschauer Straße on the other side of it.

Westkreuz station.
A man about 40 years old told me if I wanted to get to the most interesting part of the wall, I had to get to Ostbahnhof station. He took a piece of paper and draw a map. Just before we parted he said: it would be great.

Westkreuz station. 
Westkreuz station.  A young lady with a baby in a baby carrier. I asked her how I could get to the wall. She told me I needed to get to Friedrichstraße. I asked her to write it on my hand. I still don't know if she meant the street or the station.

		<h3>6.The note on the box</h3>
		1 of March 2017. 
Ostkreuz station. 
Teenager, most probably a student. I asked him how I could get to the wall. He said that the easiest way was to get to the Warschauer Straße. He wrote the name on an empty polaroid cassette box I gave him. He was the first person to sent me to the place I've already been. In that moment I understood that the circle is completed.
